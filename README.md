# AWS-Robo-Advisor

A Simple Robo Advisor leveraged by AWS ( Amazon Web Services) to give a user a recommendation for their investment base on the risk level.
The tasks to be completed: 

     * Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
     
     * Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.
     
     * Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
